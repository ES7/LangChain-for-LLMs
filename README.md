# LangChain-for-LLMs
LangChain is a framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to build complex applications that leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4. LangChain is especially useful for tasks that require integrating language models with other systems, managing interactions, and handling the flow of data.
