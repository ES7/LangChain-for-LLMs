# LangChain-for-LLMs
LangChain is a framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to build complex applications that leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4. LangChain is especially useful for tasks that require integrating language models with other systems, managing interactions, and handling the flow of data.

**`1. Model_Prompt_Parser.ipynb` :-** In this notebook we will see the models used in langchain, what are prompt templates, and what is parsing in langchain.

**`2. Memory.ipynb` :-** In this notebook we will see the different ways to store the history of conversation in langchain.

**`3. Chains.ipynb` :-** In this notebook we will see what are chains and its types and how to use it.

**`4. QnA.ipynb` :-** In this notebook we will pass a document and ask questions to the langauge model via Chains, we will also see some methods to perform this task.

**`5. Evaluation.ipynb` :-** In this notebook we will see how can we evaluate our code using LangChain.
