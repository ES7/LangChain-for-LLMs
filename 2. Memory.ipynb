    "When we use a LLM for chat conversation, the LLM itself is actually stateless. The language model itself doesn't remember the conversation we have had so far. And each transaction, each call to the API endpoint is independent. And chatvots appear to have memory only because there is usually rapid code that provides the ful conversation that is been had so far as context to the LLM. And so the memory can sotre explicitly the term or the utterances so far. And this memory storage is used as input or additional context to the LLM so that they can generate an output as if it is just having the next conversational turn, knowing what's been said before. And as th econversation becomes long, the amounts of memory needed becomes really long and does the cost of sending a lot of tokens to the LLM, which usually charges based on the number of tokens it needs to process, will also become more expensive. LangChain provides several convenient kinds of memory to store and accumulate the conversation.\n",
