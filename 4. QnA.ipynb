    "# Q&A over Documents\n",
    "One of the common and complex application people are building using an LLM is a system that can answer questions on top of or about a document. So, given a piece of text, maybe extracted from a PDF file or from a webpade or from some company's intranet internal document collection, can we use an LLM to answer questions about the content of those documents to help users gain a deeper understanding and get access to the information that they need? This is really powerful because it starts to combine these language models with data that they weren't originally trained on. So it makes them much more flexible and adaptable to our use case."

    "Language models can only inspect a few thousand words at a time. If we have really large documents then we use **embeddings** and **vector stores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings\n",
    "Embeddings create numerical representations for pieces of text. This numerical representation captures the semantic meaning of the piece of text that it's been run over. Pieces of text with similar content will have similar vectors. This lets us compare pieces of text in the vector space. This will let us easily figure out which text are like each other, which will be very useful as we think of which piece of text are like each other, which will be very useful as we think about which pieces of text we want to include when passing to the language model to answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Database\n",
    "A vector database is a way to store these vector representations that we created in the previous step. We populate these vectors with chunks of text coming from incoming documents. When we get a big incoming document, we are first going to break it up into smaller chunks. This helps create piece of text that are smaller than the original document, which is useful because we may not be able to pass the whole document to the language model. So we want to create these small chunks so we can only pass the most relevant ones to the model. We then create an embedding for each of these chunks, and then we sotre those in a vector database. That's what happens when we create the index. We can use this index during runtime to find the pieces of text most relevant to an incoming query. When a query comes in, we first create an embedding for that query. We then compare it to all the vectors in the vector database, and we pick the **n** most similar. These are then returend, and we can pass those in the prompt to the language model to get back a final answer.\n",

    "## Stuff Method\n",
    "This method is the simplest method. We simply stuff all data into the prompt as context to pass to the language model.\n",
    "- **Pros:** It makes a single call to the LLM. The LLM has access to all the data at once.\n",
    "- **Cons:** LLMs have a context length, and for large documetns or many documents this will not work as it will result in a prompt larger than the context length.\n",

    "<img src=\"map_reduce.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"300\"><br>\n",
    "This basically takes all the chunks, passe them along with the question to a language model, gets back a response, and then uses another language model call to summarize all of the individual responses into a final answer. This is really powerful because it can operate over any number of documents and we can do it with individual questions in parallel. But it does takes a lot more calls. And it does treat all the documents as independent, which may not always be the most desired thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"refine.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"300\"><br>\n",
    "This is again used to loop over many documents. But it actually does it intreatively. It builds upon the answer from the previous document. So this is really good for combining information and building up an answer over time. It will generally lead to longer answers and it is also not as fast because now the calls aren't independent. They depend on the result of previous calls. This means that it often takes a good while longer and takes just as amny calls as \"Map_reduce\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"map_rerank.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"300\"><br>\n",
    "This is pretty intresting and more experimental one where we do a single call to the language model for each document. And we also ask it to return a score. And then we select the highest score. This relies on the language model to know what the score should be. So we often have to tell it, \"it should be a high score of it's relevant to the document and really refine the instructions there\". Similar to \"Map_reduce\", all the calls are independent. So we can batch them and it is relatively fast. But again here we are making a bunch of langauge model calls. So it will be more expensive."
